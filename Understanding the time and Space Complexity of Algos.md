Common Algorithms and Their Complexities

This document lists various algorithms and their time/space complexities. Some complexities are missing - can you help fill them in?

1. Linear Search
Description: Sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found or the end of list is reached.
- Best case: O(1) (element found at the start).
- Worst case: O(n) (element found at the end or not found).
- Recursive space complexity: O(n) due to function call stack.


2. Binary Search
Description: Repeatedly divides a sorted array in half, eliminating the half that cannot contain the target value.
- Best case: O(1) (middle element is the target).
- Worst case: O(log n) (keep dividing search space).
- Recursive space complexity: O(log n) (recursion stack depth).

3. Bubble Sort
Description: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- Best case: O(n) (already sorted array).
- Worst case: O(n¬≤) (comparing every pair).
- Recursive space complexity: O(n) (function calls).

| Algorithm     | Approach   | Best Case Time | Average Case Time | Worst Case Time | Space Complexity |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Linear Search** | Iterative  | O(1)          | O(n)              | O(n)            | O(1)             |
|              | Recursive  | O(1)          | O(n)              | O(n)            | O(n) (due to recursion stack) |
| **Binary Search** | Iterative  | O(1)          | O(log n)          | O(log n)        | O(1)             |
|              | Recursive  | O(1)          | O(log n)          | O(log n)        | O(log n) (due to recursion stack) |
| **Bubble Sort** | Iterative  | O(n)          | O(n¬≤)             | O(n¬≤)           | O(1)             |
|               | Recursive  | O(n)          | O(n¬≤)             | O(n¬≤)           | O(n) (due to recursion stack) |



4. Selection Sort
Description: Divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region, repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted region to add to the sorted region.

Time Complexity: 

|**Case** | **Time Complexity** | **Description** |
|----|---------------|-----------|
|**Best Case**| O(N^2)| Even if the array is sorted, it still scans the entire array for the minimum element in each pass.|
|**Average Case**| O(N^2)| Always goes through (ùëõ ‚àí 1) iterations, making it quadratic.|
|**Worst Case** | O(N^2)| Occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order; still performs the same number of comparisons and swaps.|

Space Complexity: O(1) 
- It is an in-place sorting algorithm, using only a constant amount of extra space.


5. Insertion Sort
Description: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, by repeatedly inserting a new element into the sorted portion of the array.
Time Complexity: 

|**Case** | **Time Complexity** | **Description** |
|----|---------------|-----------|
|**Best Case**| O(N)| Occurs when the array is already sorted, requiring only n‚àí1 comparisons and no swaps.|
|**Average Case**| O(N^2)| On average, half of the elements are shifted for each insertion.|
|**Worst Case** | O(N^2)| Occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order, requiring the maximum number of shifts.|

Space Complexity: O(1)
- It sorts the array in place, needing no extra space.


6. Merge Sort
Description: Divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

**Working Principle**
- Divide: The array is recursively divided into two halves until each subarray has one element.
- Conquer: The subarrays are sorted recursively.
- Combine: The sorted subarrays are merged to form the final sorted array.

Time Complexity: 

| Case| Complexity |
|-----|------------|
| Best Case| O(n log n) |
| Average Case | O(n log n) |
| Worst Case | O(n log n) |

Since the array is divided into two halves at each step and merging takes O(n) time, the total time complexity is O(n log n).

Space Complexity:
- Merge Sort requires O(n) auxiliary space due to the temporary arrays used for merging.
-  The recursive calls contribute to an additional O(log n) space complexity for the function call stack.

7. Quick Sort
Description: Selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

**Working Principle**
- Divide: A pivot element is chosen, and the array is partitioned such that elements smaller than the pivot are placed on the left and larger elements on the right.
- Conquer: Quick Sort is recursively applied to the left and right partitions.
- Combine: The sorted partitions are combined (implicitly achieved through recursion).

Time Complexity: 

| Case | Complexity |
|-----|------------|
| Best Case | O(n log n) |
|Average Case | O(n log n) |
| Worst Case | O(n^2) |

- The worst-case occurs when the pivot consistently picks the smallest or largest element, leading to unbalanced partitions.
- Choosing an optimal pivot (e.g., median of three) improves efficiency.

Space Complexity:
- In-place sorting: Quick Sort generally requires O(log n) space for recursive function calls.
- In the worst case, the recursive depth may be O(n) (if partitions are highly unbalanced).
- No additional auxiliary arrays are needed, unlike Merge Sort.

Merge Sort and Quick Sort are two classic examples of **Divide and Conquer** algorithms used for sorting. Divide and Conquer is a fundamental algorithm design paradigm that breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and then combines their solutions to solve the original problem. 

**Comparison Table**

| Feature | Merge Sort | Quick Sort |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Time Complexity (Best/Average) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | 
| Time Complexity (Worst) | O(n log n) | O(n^2) |
| Space Complexity | O(n) | O(log n) |
| Stability | Stable | Unstable (in some implementations) |
| In-Place Sorting | No | Yes |

**Conclusion**
- Merge Sort is more suitable for linked lists and cases where stable sorting is required, despite its higher space complexity.
- Quick Sort is preferred for in-place sorting and average-case efficiency, but worst-case performance can be poor without an optimal pivot selection strategy.
- Both algorithms have their own strengths and are widely used in different applications depending on the requirements of stability, space constraints, and performance.

Space Complexity:


15. Matrix Multiplication (Naive)
Description: Na√Øve Matrix Multiplication follows the standard row-column method to multiply two matrices. 
**Time Complexity:**
- Best-case Complexity: O(mnp)
- Worst-case Complexity: O(mnp)

Since each element requires n multiplications and additions, the complexity remains O(mnp) in all cases.

**Space Complexity:**
- The space required to store the resulting matrix C is O(mp).

If auxiliary storage is considered, additional space is minimal, so the space complexity remains O(mp).

**Applications**
- Computer graphics transformations
- Scientific computing
- Machine learning and deep learning computations
- Engineering simulations

**Limitations**
1. Inefficiency: The naive approach is slow for large matrices due to its O(mnp) complexity.
2. Better Alternatives: Strassen‚Äôs Algorithm (O(n^{2.81})) and more optimized methods like the Coppersmith-Winograd Algorithm are used for faster computations.

### **Recursive vs. Iterative Algorithms: Space Complexity Comparison**  

Algorithms can be implemented using **recursion** or **iteration**, but they differ in **space complexity** due to how they manage memory.  

---

## **1. Understanding Space Complexity in Recursion**  
### How Recursion Uses Memory:  
- Recursive algorithms use the **call stack** to store function calls until they return.  
- Each recursive call **adds a new stack frame**, increasing space usage.  
- The recursion **depth determines space complexity**.  

### **Example: Quick Sort (Recursive)**
- **Space Complexity:** `O(log n)` (average case), `O(n)` (worst case when unbalanced).  
- **Reason:** The recursive function calls store partitions on the stack.  

#### **Pseudocode for Recursive Quick Sort**
```python
function quickSort(arr, low, high):
    if low < high:
        pivotIndex = partition(arr, low, high)
        quickSort(arr, low, pivotIndex - 1)  # Recursive call for left subarray
        quickSort(arr, pivotIndex + 1, high) # Recursive call for right subarray
```
- **Recursive Depth:** `O(log n)` in the best case but `O(n)` in the worst case (skewed partitioning).  
- **Memory Usage:** Each function call adds a new stack frame.  

---

## **2. Understanding Space Complexity in Iterative Algorithms**  
### How Iteration Saves Space:  
- Iterative algorithms **do not use the call stack** for recursive function calls.  
- Instead, they use **loop constructs**, requiring **constant space (`O(1)`)** if no extra data structures are needed.  

### **Example: Merge Sort (Iterative)**
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` (due to auxiliary array for merging).  
- **Reason:** Avoids recursion stack, but still requires temporary storage for merging.  

#### **Pseudocode for Iterative Merge Sort**
```python
function mergeSortIterative(arr):
    n = length(arr)
    currentSize = 1
    while currentSize < n:
        left = 0
        while left < n-1:
            mid = min(left + currentSize - 1, n-1)
            right = min(left + 2*currentSize - 1, n-1)
            merge(arr, left, mid, right)
            left += 2 * currentSize
        currentSize *= 2
```
- **No recursion stack used** ‚Üí avoids `O(log n)` recursive call overhead.  
- **Still requires `O(n)` auxiliary space** for merging.

## **3. Comparing Recursive vs. Iterative Implementations**  

| Algorithm | Recursive Space Complexity | Iterative Space Complexity |  
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|  
| Quick Sort | `O(log n)` (best/avg), `O(n)` (worst) | `O(1)` (if stack avoided) |  
| Merge Sort | `O(n)` (auxiliary array + recursion depth) | `O(n)` (auxiliary array) |  
| Fibonacci | `O(n)` (due to recursion depth) | `O(1)` (loop-based) |  
| DFS | `O(h)`, where `h` is tree/graph depth | `O(n)` (if stack used explicitly) |  
| BFS | `O(n)` (queue storage) | `O(n)` (queue storage) |  

---
## **How Recursion Impacts Space Usage with Stack Frames**  

### **What Happens in Memory During Recursion?**  
When a function calls itself recursively, the system **allocates memory** on the **call stack** for each function call. These stack frames store:  
- **Function parameters**  
- **Local variables**  
- **Return address (where to continue execution after returning)**  

Each recursive call **adds a new stack frame**, and these frames remain in memory until the function returns. If recursion is too deep, it can cause **stack overflow**.

---

### **Example: Recursive Fibonacci Calculation**
Let's take a simple recursive Fibonacci function:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
- **Function Calls for `fibonacci(4)`:**  
```
fibonacci(4)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fibonacci(3)  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fibonacci(2)  
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fibonacci(1) ‚Üí returns 1  
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fibonacci(0) ‚Üí returns 0  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fibonacci(1) ‚Üí returns 1  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fibonacci(2)  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fibonacci(1) ‚Üí returns 1  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fibonacci(0) ‚Üí returns 0  
```
- **Stack Frame Growth (Call Stack):**
```
fibonacci(4)
  fibonacci(3)
    fibonacci(2)
      fibonacci(1)  (returns)
      fibonacci(0)  (returns)
    fibonacci(1)  (returns)
  fibonacci(2)
    fibonacci(1)  (returns)
    fibonacci(0)  (returns)
```
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` (for call stack depth).  
- **Problem:** Many redundant calls (`fibonacci(2)` appears twice).  

---

### **Recursion vs. Iteration: Call Stack Usage**  
| Approach | Space Complexity | Why? |
|----------|----------------|------|
| **Recursive Fibonacci** | `O(n)` | Each call adds a stack frame until `n` reaches 0. |
| **Iterative Fibonacci** | `O(1)` | Uses only a few variables, no extra function calls. |
