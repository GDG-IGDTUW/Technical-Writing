# 🌥️ CLOUD COMPUTING

# **Introduction 🧑‍💻**

Nowadays, Cloud computing ☁️ is adopted by every company, whether it is an MNC or a startup many are still migrating towards it because of the cost-cutting, lesser maintenance, and the increased capacity of the data with the help of servers maintained by the cloud providers.

One more reason for this drastic change from the On-premises servers of the companies to the Cloud providers is the ‘**Pay as you go 💵**’ principle-based services provided by them i.e., you only have to pay for the service which you are using. The disadvantage On-premises server holds is that if the server is not in use the company still has to pay for it.
#
# What is Cloud Computing 💻☁️?
Cloud computing is a technology that enables the delivery of computing resources—such as servers 🖥️, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet ("the cloud") on a pay-as-you-go 💵 basis. Instead of maintaining physical infrastructure, businesses and individuals can use remote servers 🌍 hosted by cloud providers to store data, run applications, and perform computing tasks.

This approach offers several advantages, including scalability, flexibility, cost efficiency, and security. Cloud services are typically categorized into three main models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 🏗️, Platform as a Service (PaaS) 🛠️, and Software as a Service (SaaS) 📲, each catering to different computing needs. Popular cloud providers like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, and **Microsoft Azure** offer a wide range of services, enabling businesses to innovate faster, improve collaboration, and enhance reliability without the burden of managing on-premise hardware.

Cloud computing has revolutionized industries by supporting modern applications like AI 🤖, big data analytics, IoT, and remote work solutions, making it an essential technology in today’s digital era.

## What is Cloud Backup and disaster recovery?


# 🌩 Selecting a Cloud disaster recovery provider

Cloud disaster recovery (DR) solutions provide businesses with a robust mechanism to recover critical data and systems in case of a disaster. Choosing the right provider requires evaluating several factors to ensure reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.
## 📌 Five Criteria for Selecting a Cloud Disaster Recovery Provider:
Below is a detailed guide to the key criteria that should be considered when selecting a cloud disaster recovery provider. These factors are essential to help businesses make informed decisions about backup and recovery solutions that align with their operational needs, security requirements, and budget constraints. Each criterion plays a vital role in ensuring that the chosen provider can deliver reliable, scalable, and efficient disaster recovery services. By carefully evaluating these aspects, users can select a provider that minimizes downtime, protects sensitive data, and supports long-term business continuity in the face of potential disasters or disruptions.
## 1. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) ⏳:

- **Explanation 📖:** Evaluate the provider's ability to meet your organization's RTO and RPO requirements. RTO defines how quickly data and systems can be restored after a disaster, while RPO determines how much data loss is acceptable.
