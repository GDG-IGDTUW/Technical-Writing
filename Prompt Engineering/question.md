- Different **types of prompts** (direct, open-ended, contextual, step-by-step, role-playing, constrained, comparative, creative)  
- The role of prompt engineering in optimizing AI interactions  
- **Pros and cons** of prompt engineering  
- Strategies for improving prompts  
- Real-world **use cases** across different domains  
- Detailed prompting techniques such as **zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, iterative, negative, hybrid prompting, and prompt chaining**  
- Common pitfalls in prompt engineering and ways to avoid them  
- Tools used for testing and optimizing prompts  
- Ethical considerations, responsible use, and bias mitigation in prompt engineering  
- Advanced techniques including multi-step reasoning, context awareness, and collaborative prompt engineering  
- Methods for **evaluating prompt performance** using qualitative and quantitative approaches
