# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## What is SDLC?
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) started in the 1960s to help big companies manage complicated business systems. Over time, it has changed and now includes various methods and models for developing software.

Basically, ‘The Software Development Life Cycle’ (SDLC) is a step-by-step process used to design, create, and test high-quality software. It outlines each stage of making software so that each part can be done efficiently and deliver the final product on time and within budget, meeting a user's needs.

**The main goal of SDLC is to ensure the software is of good quality and easy to maintain.**

Tuhin Bhatt, co-founder of Intelivita, in his blog post defines 6 major benefits of SDLC; _the importance_ of it are as follows – <br>
1.	**Enhances Product Quality:** SDLC helps in identifying and fixing issues early by breaking development into phases like requirements analysis, design, coding, and testing. This method helps catch problems at their source, reducing the risk of failure.<br>
2.	**Improves Project Management:** SDLC starts with a clear understanding of the project's scope, goals, and requirements. It encourages careful planning before starting, ensuring the project stays on track and meets its objectives. This detailed planning helps manage the project better and reduces the risk of failure.<br>
3.	**Manages Risks Effectively:** Many projects fail due to poor planning, lack of resources, and technical issues. The SDLC helps reduce these risks by starting with proper planning and using different types of testing throughout the development process. This helps identify and fix problems early, significantly lowering the risk of project failure.<br>
4.	**Enhances Communication & Collaboration:** SDLC improves teamwork and communication among stakeholders, leading to successful project development and reducing the chance of failure. It ensures everyone understands the project requirements.<br>
5.	**Enables Efficient Resource Utilization:** SDLC ensures that resources, roles, and tasks are assigned effectively. This approach ensures the right people are working on the right tasks, completing the project on time. <br>
6.	**Flexibility & Adaptability:** SDLC offers the flexibility to adjust and refine project requirements. Models like Agile help teams respond to market changes and evolving customer needs by dividing projects into smaller parts called "sprints." This approach makes projects more responsive and efficient. It ensures ongoing enhancement and innovation is happening.<br>

So, we can safely say that SDLC allows us to build good quality products by offering a structured, efficient, and client-focused approach.

## Phases of SDLC
Though somewhere you will find the phases are 6 and some people compress them to just 5 phases! Here, we describe 7 phases of SDLC, covering all time-stamps of a software's development life cycle - 
1. **Planning:** Project planning or just 'planning' is an initial phase where the project's scope, objectives and feasibility are determined.
   Key activities of planning includes -
   1. *Project scope:* Defining the boundaries of the project and its deliverables.
   2. *Resource planning:* Identifying the resources (time, money, manpower) needed.
   3. *Risk analysis:* Evaluating potential risks and developing mitigation strategies.
   4. *Schedule planning:* Creating a timeline for the project with milestones.
2. **Requirement Analysis:** In this phase, a documented version of the functions and non-functions that would be delivered as an end-product to the customer are defined.
   Key activities of requirement analysis include -
   1. *Stakeholder interviews:* Meeting with users, clients, and other stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.
   2. *Requirements documentation:* Creating detailed documents that outline functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (performance, security, etc.) requirements.
   3. *Requirement validation:* Ensuring that the requirements are clear, complete, and feasible.
3. **Design:** After you get a requirements' document, you will create an architecture of the software based on those requirements.
   Key activities of design phase are -
   1. *System design:* Defining the overall system architecture, including hardware and software components.
   2. *Detailed design:* Creating detailed design specifications for each component, including data models, user interfaces, and algorithms.
   3. *Prototyping:* Building prototypes to validate design choices and get feedback from the users.
4. **Implementation:** Finally, it's the coding phase. This is the phase is which the actual code is written based on the design phase.
   Key activities of Implementation are as follows -
   1. Coding: Developers write code based on the design documents, following coding standards and best practices.
   2. Code reviews: Peer reviews of code to ensure quality and adherence to standards.
   3. Version control: Using tools like Git to manage changes to the codebase and maintain a history of revisions.
5. **Testing:** In this phase, the code is checked at different levels to find and fix errors.
   Key activities of testing includes -
   1. *Unit testing:* Testing individual components or units of code to ensure they work correctly.
   2. *Integration testing:* Testing the interactions between components to ensure they work together as expected.
   3. *System testing:* Testing the complete system to ensure it meets the requirements.
   4. *User acceptance testing (UAT):* Testing the system with real users to ensure it meets their needs and is ready for deployment.
6. **Deployment:** Once the software has passed all tests, the software is deployed to the production environment where it becomes available to the users for use.
   Key activities of deployment are -
   1. *Deployment planning:* Creating a detailed plan for deploying the software, including rollback procedures in case of issues.
   2. *Data migration:* Moving data from old systems to the new system, if necessary.
   3. *User training:* Providing training to users to ensure they can effectively use the new software.
   4. *Go-live:* Deploying the software and making it available to users.
8. **Maintenance:** Post-deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase where it’s monitored for performance and any issues are resolved. Updates and enhancements are made as needed to improve the functionality and security.
   Key activities of maintenance are -
   1. *Monitoring:* Continuously monitoring the software for performance, security, and user issues.
   2. *Bug fixing:* Addressing any defects or issues that arise after deployment.
   3. *Updates and enhancements:* Adding new features or making improvements based on user feedback and changing requirements.
   4. *Documentation updates:* Keeping all relevant documentation up to date with the latest changes and enhancements.
      
Each phase is crucial for the successful development and delivery of the software. It’s a cycle, so once maintenance is done, the process can start over for new features or improvements.
