## Question: Understanding Time and Space Complexity

Explain the concepts of **time complexity** and **space complexity** in algorithm analysis.

Your answer should include:
- Definition of time complexity and space complexity  
- Why they are important in evaluating algorithm efficiency  
- Explanation of **Big O notation**  
- Common time complexities (O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²)) with examples  
- Difference between best-case, average-case, and worst-case complexity  
- How space complexity is affected by variables, data structures, and recursion  
- Real-world scenarios where time and space trade-offs are important
