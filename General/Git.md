# Git Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of Git, including installation instructions, basic commands, and common branching strategies used in software development projects(Add more details and images if you can).

**Git** is a tool used to track file changes, especially when multiple people are working on a project. It is a **version control system**, which means it helps you manage different versions of your files and makes it easier to work on a project as a team. 

### Why Git is used in software development projects:
1. **Track Changes**: Git keeps a history of all file changes, so you can see what has been modified and when.
2. **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other's work. Git helps merge their changes.
3. **Error Recovery**: If you make a mistake, you can return to your work's earlier version.
4. **Branching and Merging**: You can create separate branches (copies) of a project to try new ideas or features without affecting the main project. Once everything is ready, you can combine the changes back.
5. **Transparency**: It shows who made what changes, making it easier to understand the progress and contributions of team members.

Git is popular in software development because it is fast, reliable, and helps teams work together effectively.


## Installing Git


### For Windows OS
1. Visit the official Git website at [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win).  
   The download should begin automatically. If it doesn't, click on the appropriate link for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).

2. Launch the downloaded installer and follow the instructions provided.

3. Select the default options or modify the installation settings based on your preferences.

4. Once the installation is complete, open Command Prompt and confirm the installation by entering:  
   `git --version`.

### For macOS:
  1. **Install using Homebrew**: If you already have Homebrew installed, run the following command:  
   `brew install git`.

2. **If Homebrew is not installed**: To install Homebrew, open Terminal and run the following command:  
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
   Once Homebrew is installed, proceed with the command:  
   `brew install git`.

3. **Alternative method**: If you prefer, download the `.dmg` installer from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the on-screen instructions.

4. **Verify the installation**: After the installation is complete, open Terminal and check the Git version by typing:  
   `git --version`.



### For Linux OS:
For Ubuntu/Debian:  
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

For Fedora:  
```bash
sudo dnf install git
```

**Verify the installation**:  
After installation, open the terminal and check the Git version by running:  
```bash
git --version
```

## Configuring Git

Once Git is installed, it's essential to configure it with your username and email address. This information will be associated with your commits and helps identify you as the author of the changes.

### Basic Configuration Commands

To set your username and email globally (for all repositories on your system), use the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

### Setting Configuration for a Specific Repository

If you want to set a username and email for just a single repository, navigate to the repository directory and run:

```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

### Verifying the Configuration
You can verify the configuration using this command:

```bash
git config --global --list
```
This will display the currently configured username, email, and other global Git settings.

### Example Output
After running the configuration commands, the output of git config --global --list might look like this:

```bash
user.name=John Doe
user.email=johndoe@example.com
```
## Using Git - Basic Commands

The following are some of the basic Git commands used to manage repositories, track changes, and collaborate with other developers, complete them with the appropriate commands:

### 1. Initializing a Repository

To start tracking changes in a project, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
git init
```

### 2. Cloning a Repository

To clone an existing repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 3. Staging Changes

Before committing changes, you need to stage them. Use the following command to stage changes:

```bash
git add <file_name>
git add 
```

### 4. Committing Changes

Committing staged changes to the repository:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### 5. Checking Status

Check the status of your working directory:

```bash
git status
```

### 6. Viewing Commit History

View the commit history of the repository:

```bash
git log
```

### Branching Strategies Overview
Branching strategies define how code changes are managed and integrated in a version control system like Git. Below are the commonly used strategies and how they can be implemented in a typical workflow.

---

### 1. **Feature Branching**
Feature branching involves creating a new branch for every feature or task. This allows developers to work on new features in isolation without affecting the main codebase.

- **Branch Creation**: Branches are created from the main branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`) for each feature or bug fix.
- **Merging**: Once the feature is complete and reviewed, it is merged back into the main branch using a pull request (PR) or merge request (MR).
- **Deletion**: After merging, the feature branch is deleted to keep the repository clean.

**Commands**:
```bash
# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-login

# Push the branch to the remote repository
git push -u origin feature/new-login

# Merge the branch into the main branch
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-login

# Delete the branch locally and remotely
git branch -d feature/new-login
git push origin --delete feature/new-login
```

---

### 2. **Release Branching**
Release branches are created to prepare a specific release, allowing the team to stabilize the code, perform testing, and apply final fixes.

- **Branch Creation**: A release branch is created from the main development branch (e.g., `develop`) when the release is feature-complete.
- **Merging**: Once the release is ready, the release branch is merged into `main` for deployment and back into `develop` to include any final fixes.
- **Deletion**: After merging, the release branch is deleted.

**Commands**:
```bash
# Create and switch to a new release branch
git checkout -b release/1.0.0

# Push the branch to the remote repository
git push -u origin release/1.0.0

# Merge the release branch into main and develop
git checkout main
git merge release/1.0.0
git checkout develop
git merge release/1.0.0

# Delete the release branch locally and remotely
git branch -d release/1.0.0
git push origin --delete release/1.0.0
```

---

### 3. **GitFlow**
GitFlow is a more structured workflow with dedicated branches for features, releases, and hotfixes. The main branches are:
- `main`: Contains stable, production-ready code.
- `develop`: Acts as the integration branch for ongoing development.

Other branches include:
- Feature branches (`feature/*`): For individual features or tasks.
- Release branches (`release/*`): For preparing releases.
- Hotfix branches (`hotfix/*`): For critical bug fixes.

**Commands**:
```bash
# Feature branch example
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/add-user-authentication
git push -u origin feature/add-user-authentication

# Release branch example
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/2.0.0
git push -u origin release/2.0.0

# Hotfix branch example
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/fix-login-bug
git push -u origin hotfix/fix-login-bug

# Merging and cleanup
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/fix-login-bug
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/fix-login-bug
git branch -d hotfix/fix-login-bug
git push origin --delete hotfix/fix-login-bug
```

---

### 1. Creating a Branch



```bash
git branch <branch_name>
```

Alternatively, you can combine these commands using:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

### 2. Merging Branches



```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

### 3. Resolving Conflicts



```bash
git add <resolved_file>
git commit
```

### 4. Deleting a Branch



```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

## VERSION CONTROL
### Comparison of Version Control Systems  

#### 1. **Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)**  
- **Definition**: Relies on a single central server to store all versioned files. Users must connect to this server to retrieve or update files.  
- **Examples**: Subversion (SVN), Perforce.  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Simpler to manage with a single repository.  
  - Easy to understand and use for small teams.  
- **Disadvantages**:  
  - Server failure leads to downtime.  
  - Requires constant internet access for most operations.  

#### 2. **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**  
- **Definition**: Every user has a complete copy of the repository, including history, allowing offline work and decentralization.  
- **Examples**: Git, Mercurial.  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Full offline capabilities for all operations.  
  - No single point of failure, making it more resilient.  
  - Faster operations since many tasks are local.  
- **Disadvantages**:  
  - More complex for beginners.  
  - Requires more storage as every user maintains a full repository copy.  

#### 3. **Local Version Control System (LVCS)**  
- **Definition**: Tracks file changes only on a local machine, without collaboration or centralized control.  
- **Examples**: RCS (Revision Control System), SCCS (Source Code Control System).  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Simple and lightweight.  
  - Does not depend on a network or server.  
- **Disadvantages**:  
  - Lacks collaboration capabilities.  
  - Cannot manage shared repositories across multiple users.  

### Key Differences  
- CVCS is centralized and requires a server, suitable for small teams with limited collaboration needs.  
- DVCS supports decentralized workflows, offline operations, and enhanced collaboration, making it ideal for modern development teams.  
- LVCS is limited to individual use and is outdated for most current development practices.  

### Key Features of Version Control

Version control systems (VCS) are essential tools in modern software development and collaborative projects. Git, one of the most popular distributed version control systems, offers numerous features that streamline workflows and enhance productivity. Below are the key features of version control systems like Git:

#### 1. **Tracking Changes**
- VCS keeps a detailed history of every change made to a project, including additions, deletions, and modifications.
- This allows developers to review previous versions, identify when changes were made, and understand why they were implemented.

#### 2. **Collaboration**
- Facilitates teamwork by enabling multiple contributors to work on the same project simultaneously.
- Merges changes from different contributors while minimizing conflicts.
- Provides features like branches to allow parallel development without affecting the main codebase.

#### 3. **Rollback Functionality**
- Allows users to revert to a previous state of the project in case of errors or bugs.
- Ensures that accidental changes can be undone without disrupting the workflow.

#### 4. **Branching and Merging**
- Supports the creation of branches for testing, developing new features, or fixing bugs without interfering with the main branch.
- Offers tools for efficiently merging branches back into the main codebase.

#### 5. **Distributed Development**
- Enables every developer to have a complete copy of the project repository, including its history.
- Facilitates offline work, ensuring that developers can commit changes locally and sync them later.

#### 6. **Conflict Resolution**
- Provides mechanisms for identifying and resolving conflicts when changes from multiple contributors overlap.
- Ensures that collaboration remains seamless even in large teams.

#### 7. **Audit Trail**
- Maintains a log of who made changes, when, and why, providing accountability and transparency.
- Supports detailed commit messages for better documentation.

#### 8. **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**
- Works seamlessly with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools to automate testing and deployment processes.
- Ensures that changes are tested before integration, improving software quality.

#### 9. **Lightweight and Fast**
- Git, in particular, is designed to be efficient, with quick operations for branching, merging, and retrieving repository history.

#### 10. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- Supports various operating systems, making it accessible to a wide range of developers and teams.

By leveraging these features, version control systems like Git empower developers to manage projects efficiently, maintain high code quality, and collaborate effectively.
