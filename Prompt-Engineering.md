# Prompt Engineering

## What is it?
<!--Explain the fundamentals of prompt engineering and its significance in optimizing language model interactions.-->
In today's modern world, Artificial Intelligence(AI) is increasingly being used to assist a wide range of tasks, from content creation to problem solving. In every possible field we can think of, we find AI being used. As AI models have become an integral part of our lives, the ability to effectively interact with them becomes crucial. This is where we start the discussion of Prompt Engineering.

The practice of designing and improving input text(prompt) which is entered to guide Large Language Models (LLM's) such as ChatGPT for producing desired output is termed as Prompt Engineering. It is all about structuring the instructions to get best possible output. In this, queries are structured in a way that maximizes the model's efficiency, performance and makes the conversation more meaningful.

### What is a Prompt?
A Prompt is a detailed text in natural language given to a model to get desired or expected output. It is an interaction between a user and an AI model.

### Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering
The quality of the prompt directly affects the quality of the response. Hence, there are a few fundamentals need to be followed while interacting with a model.

#### 1. Clarity
Be clear about what is needed. If the prompt is vague, the output will also be vague.

#### 2. Context
Provide the model with enough background information to understand your need.

#### 3. Break into Steps
Rather than entering one big instruction, break down the complex task into smaller instructions.

#### 4. Use of Examples

## How does it work?
Prompts play a crucial role in shaping the behavior and outcomes of a language model. They serve as the input or instructions that guide the model’s responses. The structure, clarity, specificity, and intent of a prompt directly influence the quality, relevance, and style of the output.
### 1. **Direct Instruction Prompts**
   - These prompts clearly state the task or desired outcome.
   - **Impact:** Produces precise and task-focused responses.
   - **Example:** 
     - Prompt: *"Summarize the plot of 'Pride and Prejudice' in two sentences."*
     - Output: *"Pride and Prejudice follows Elizabeth Bennet as she navigates societal expectations and her relationship with Mr. Darcy, overcoming misunderstandings and pride. Ultimately, love triumphs as they both grow as individuals."*

### 2. **Open-Ended Prompts**
   - These allow for a broad interpretation, leading to creative or exploratory responses.
   - **Impact:** Encourages varied, imaginative, or diverse outputs but can risk being unfocused.
   - **Example:** 
     - Prompt: *"What are your thoughts on the future of artificial intelligence?"*
     - Output: *"Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize industries, improve healthcare, and address global challenges, but it also raises concerns about ethics, privacy, and employment."*

### 3. **Contextual Prompts**
   - These provide background information or examples to help the model generate more informed or relevant responses.
   - **Impact:** Results in tailored and context-aware outputs.
   - **Example:**
     - Prompt: *"In the context of environmental sustainability, explain the importance of renewable energy."*
     - Output: *"Renewable energy is crucial for environmental sustainability as it reduces greenhouse gas emissions, mitigates climate change, and provides a cleaner, inexhaustible energy source compared to fossil fuels."*

### 4. **Step-by-Step Prompts**
   - These break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
   - **Impact:** Generates detailed and methodical responses.
   - **Example:**
     - Prompt: *"Explain how to bake a cake, step by step."*
     - Output: *"1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. 2. Mix the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder) in one bowl. 3. In another bowl, mix wet ingredients (eggs, milk, oil). 4. Combine the mixtures, pour into a greased pan, and bake for 30 minutes."*

### 5. **Role-Playing Prompts**
   - These ask the model to adopt a specific persona, tone, or perspective.
   - **Impact:** Produces responses aligned with the assigned role or tone.
   - **Example:**
     - Prompt: *"You are a motivational speaker. Write an inspiring message for someone feeling discouraged."*
     - Output: *"Remember, every setback is a setup for a comeback. Believe in your ability to overcome challenges and use them as stepping stones to your success."*

### 6. **Multiple-Choice or Constrained Prompts**
   - These limit the response options or ask the model to choose from predefined alternatives.
   - **Impact:** Creates focused outputs and reduces ambiguity.
   - **Example:**
     - Prompt: *"Do you prefer tea or coffee? Why?"*
     - Output: *"I prefer coffee because it provides a quick energy boost and has a rich flavor."*

### 7. **Comparative Prompts**
   - These ask the model to evaluate or compare two or more subjects.
   - **Impact:** Encourages analytical and balanced responses.
   - **Example:**
     - Prompt: *"Compare the benefits of remote work versus office work."*
     - Output: *"Remote work offers flexibility and reduces commuting time, while office work fosters direct collaboration and team bonding."*

### 8. **Creative Prompts**
